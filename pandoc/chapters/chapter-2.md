# Product Management and other roles

When talking about Product Management, one of the first questions people ask
is what's the difference between a Product Manager, a Program Manager, and a
Project Manager.

This is a relevant question, and I think that most of the confusion comes from
the fact that these three roles mean different things for different companies.

It doesn't help that both three roles have the same acronym - PM. So when
someone says that their PM is responsible for the project being delayed, it's
not obvious to which role they're referring to.

One of the best ways to find out what a role means for a specific company, is to
read a couple of job postings for that position in a specific company. If
you want to know what is Google's definition of a Product Manager, the best
way is to read job postings for Product Managers at Google.

For big established companies like Google this strategy works great. It can even
be more reliable than just asking someone that works in another department at
Google.

Big companies with a repeatable business model like Google spend a lot of time
thinking about how to optimize their internal processes, how to minimize the
risk of hiring the wrong person, and how to create a career path for each role
they have inside the company.

Since they've spent a ton of time doing that, their job postings will usually
be very structured and list the areas of responsibility for a given role.

Startups are a whole different story. Startups are also very concerned with
hiring the best person for the job, but by definition a startup is a company
that is still looking for a repeatable business model.
Until the team finds one, they'll have to pivot and constantly change what
they are building and the processes they are using.

This means that it's hard to tell what a specific role is for a startup because
that person will be wearing multiple hats since there's not much people but
there's a lot of work to be done, and the tasks that need to be done will be
changing at a fast pace, until the startup finds a repeatable business model.

The best way to know what are the areas of responsibility for a role in a
startup, is to go for a coffee with the founders or someone that has that
role.

Having said that, here's the more or less standard definition for these
areas of responsibility:

* Project management: Makes sure the project is delivered on time;
* Program management: Are usually more technical than project managers, or given
more authority over the team they're working with;
* Product management: Makes sure the team tackles the

Let's explore a bit more these three roles.

## Project management

There are companies that market and sell things that are not necessarily a
product, but a service.


They can offer financial consulting like Deloitte,
PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, KPMG, and many others do. They can offer
HR staffing like Randstad or Adecco. They can do marketing campaigns like
Ogilvy & Mather. You get the idea.

So while companies like this don't have a product, they still run projects and
need to make sure projects are delivered on budget and on time. And that's
basically what a project manager does. It sounds simpler, but the reality
is that most projects end up being late, exceeding their budget, or both.

For simple projects, it's not that hard to estimate how long the project is
going to cost and take to complete. But most projects are not like that.

Most projects will have a lot of things that need to be figured out as the project
goes. The multiple teams working on the project need to be coordinated so that
time is not wasted when people depend on one another.

It might also make sense to offload a specific part of the project to another
company. In that case the project manager needs to make sure the external
contractor delivers that subproject on time and on budget. If they don't the
overall project is at risk.

The project manager is also the first point of contact for the leads of each
teams working in the project to raise any issues that might affect the project.

When you're a product company there's a certain point when it might start to
make a sense to have both product and project managers. The first helps define
what should be built, the second makes sure it gets built on budget and on
time.

Project management can be as deep and wide as you want it to be. If you're
building the next generation commercial airplane for sure you'll need a ton
of tools and processes due to the complexity of the project and the number of
people involved.

But if you're a startup you don't need all of those. Actually trying to apply
rigid tools and processes will probably backfire, because a startup by
definition is a company that is still iterating on their business model.
So a startup needs to be optimized for learning and finding product-market fit,
and that requires constantly changing processes.

Given that in a startup a product manager wears multiple hats and is responsible
for shipping on budget and on time, we'll cover some project management
essentials in

## Program management

When projects get too complex, like building the next generation commercial
airliner, or you want to make changes to the way a company is doing things,
then you might need a program manager.

In some companies, project managers are not very technical, so they might not
be able to fully assess the risks of the project, or even the requirements and
possible solutions. It's also possible that program managers help define what
projects the company should focus on, and what projects should be offloaded to
external companies, or just postponed.


## More notes

There's a couple of responsibilities and activities that might overlap between
Program Managers, Project Managers, and Product Managers. But the first two roles
are mostly responsible for making sure the team is building the product on
schedule and on budget.


## Summary

Each of these areas is really interesting, and if you're planning on being a
Product Manager at a startup, you need to be ready to wear the hats of a
Product Manager, Project Manager, and Program Manager.

As the startup grows you'll find other people that can work full time wearing
a single hat, but until then you'll have to make sure you're building the
right product, and doing it on time and budget.

Making sure you're building the right product needs to always be front and
center. It doesn't matter if you're keeping your deadlines but it turns out
that you're building something that no one wants.

Sure, you'll get cookie points for making it on time, but the startup will have
to pivot or run out of business.
