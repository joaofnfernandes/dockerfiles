# Product Management and other roles

When talking about Product Management, one of the first questions people ask
is what's the difference between a Product Manager, a Program Manager, and a
Project Manager.

This is a relevant question, and I think that most of the confusion comes from
the fact that these three roles mean different things for different companies.

It doesn't help that both three roles have the same acronym - PM. So when
someone says that their PM is responsible for the project being delayed, it's
not obvious to which role they're referring to.

One of the best ways to find out what a role means for a specific company, is to
read a couple of job postings for that position in a specific company. If
you want to know what is Google's definition of a Product Manager, the best
way is to read job postings for Product Managers at Google.

For big established companies like Google this strategy works great. It can even
be more reliable than just asking someone that works in another department at
Google.

Big companies with a repeatable business model like Google spend a lot of time
thinking about how to optimize their internal processes, how to minimize the
risk of hiring the wrong person, and how to create a career path for each role
they have inside the company.

Since they've spent a ton of time doing that, their job postings will usually
be very structured and list the areas of responsibility for a given role.

Startups are a whole different story. Startups are also very concerned with
hiring the best person for the job, but by definition a startup is a company
that is still looking for a repeatable business model.
Until the team finds one, they'll have to pivot and constantly change what
they are building and the processes they are using.

This means that it's hard to tell what a specific role is for a startup because
that person will be wearing multiple hats since there's not much people but
there's a lot of work to be done, and the tasks that need to be done will be
changing at a fast pace, until the startup finds a repeatable business model.

The best way to know what are the areas of responsibility for a role in a
startup, is to go for a coffee with the founders or someone that has that
role.

Having said that, here's the more or less standard definition for these
areas of responsibility:

* Project management: Makes sure the project is delivered on time;
* Program management: Are usually more technical than project managers, or given
more authority over the team they're working with;
* Product management: Makes sure the team tackles the

Let's explore a bit more these three roles.

## Project management

A ton of companies out there make a business out of selling things that are
not necessarily a product.

Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, and KPMG offer financial
consulting and auditing. Randstad, Adecco, and many others offer HR staffing.
Ogilvy & Mather, Publicis, and others manage public relations.
Infosys, Tata, Accenture, Capgemini, and many others do IT consulting.

Companies like these usually don't have a product or portfolio of products
to sell, instead, they provide services to their customers. And they'll have to
make sure the services or projects they deliver are done on budget and on time.

So there's your basic definition of a project manager. Someone that makes sure
the project is delivered on budget and on time.

Sure, for simple projects you can just do a back of the napkin estimation and
take it from there. But most projects are not like that.
Most projects start by being a fuzzy idea when it is started, and then things
change as the project starts going.

The customer adds new requirements to the project. People learn that there are
dependencies between tasks that risk delaying the project. Things are more
costly than originally predicted.

A project manager will keep track of all these things and make sure the project
keeps moving forward. They also coordinate the multiple teams and dependencies
to make sure things are getting according to schedule.

It might also make sense to offload a specific part of the project to another
company. In that case the project manager needs to make sure the external
contractor delivers that subproject on time and on budget. If they don't the
overall project is at risk.

The project manager is also the first point of contact for the leads of each
teams working in the project to raise any issues that might affect the project.

Overall, making sure a big project runs on budget and on time is tough work
given that most projects end up being late, exceeding their budget, or both.

Now contrast the companies that were mentioned earlier with companies that have
to manage a product or a portfolio of products.

These are companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft in the digital world.
Proctor and Gamble, Unilever, and Nestle in the consumer goods space.
GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, and Merk in the pharmaceutical industry. A big chunk
of the money these companies make are by selling products either to consumers
or other companies.

These companies need to make sure these products are built on budget and on
time, but most importantly, they need to make sure they are creating the
right products to begin with.

To them it doesn't really matter if a product is completed on time but
there's no one out there that wants to buy it. And that is basically what
draws the line in the sand for most Project Managers.

A Project Manager is responsible to make sure the project gets completed on
time, but usually doesn't define the type of project, or if the project is
relevant or not to a set of users.

But don't take this the wrong way. Project Management is really hard given
that most projects end up being late and exceeding their budget. Project
Management can also be as deep as you want it to be.

If you're building the next generation commercial airplane for sure you'll need
a ton proven tools and processes in place to make sure things run according
to schedule. For large and complex projects like that, a small bump in the road
might affect the overall plan.

On the other hand, if you're a startup and still trying to find a repeatable
business model you'll need less rigid tools and processes. The focus should
be in finding product-market fit, and that requires to constantly change the
plan until you find it.

## Program management

When projects get too complex, like building the next generation commercial
airliner, or you want to make changes to the way a company is doing things,
then you might need a program manager.

In some companies, project managers are not very technical, so they might not
be able to fully assess the risks of the project, or even the requirements and
possible solutions. It's also possible that program managers help define what
projects the company should focus on, and what projects should be offloaded to
external companies, or just postponed.


## More notes

There's a couple of responsibilities and activities that might overlap between
Program Managers, Project Managers, and Product Managers. But the first two roles
are mostly responsible for making sure the team is building the product on
schedule and on budget.


## Summary

Each of these areas is really interesting, and if you're planning on being a
Product Manager at a startup, you need to be ready to wear the hats of a
Product Manager, Project Manager, and Program Manager.

As the startup grows you'll find other people that can work full time wearing
a single hat, but until then you'll have to make sure you're building the
right product, and doing it on time and budget.

Making sure you're building the right product needs to always be front and
center. It doesn't matter if you're keeping your deadlines but it turns out
that you're building something that no one wants.

Sure, you'll get cookie points for making it on time, but the startup will have
to pivot or run out of business.
