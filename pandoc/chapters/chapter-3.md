# Product manager vs project manager

One thing that's not obvious at first is the difference between multiple
activities and roles that seem to be related:

* Product management
* Project management
* Program management

If you're working for a startup, the difference between these activities is not
much relevant. You'll probably be doing things and taking ownership of areas
that on a bigger company would fall outside the Product Manager responsibilities.

This book is written for people with a startup mentality. Your hungry for
knowledge and ownership. So in the next couple of chapters we'll see a couple
of activities and tools that might not be covered in your typical product
management.

But given that you might find these titles out in the wild, it makes sense to
take a 5-minute detour and understand what's the difference between these roles
and product management.



## Project management

There are companies that market and sell things that are not necessarily a
product, but a service.


They can offer financial consulting like Deloitte,
PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, KPMG, and many others do. They can offer
HR staffing like Randstad or Adecco. They can do marketing campaigns like
Ogilvy & Mather. You get the idea.

So while companies like this don't have a product, they still run projects and
need to make sure projects are delivered on budget and on time. And that's
basically what a project manager does. It sounds simpler, but the reality
is that most projects end up being late, exceeding their budget, or both.

For simple projects, it's not that hard to estimate how long the project is
going to cost and take to complete. But most projects are not like that.

Most projects will have a lot of things that need to be figured out as the project
goes. The multiple teams working on the project need to be coordinated so that
time is not wasted when people depend on one another.

It might also make sense to offload a specific part of the project to another
company. In that case the project manager needs to make sure the external
contractor delivers that subproject on time and on budget. If they don't the
overall project is at risk.

The project manager is also the first point of contact for the leads of each
teams working in the project to raise any issues that might affect the project.

When you're a product company there's a certain point when it might start to
make a sense to have both product and project managers. The first helps define
what should be built, the second makes sure it gets built on budget and on
time.

Project management can be as deep and wide as you want it to be. If you're
building the next generation commercial airplane for sure you'll need a ton
of tools and processes due to the complexity of the project and the number of
people involved.

But if you're a startup you don't need all of those. Actually trying to apply
rigid tools and processes will probably backfire, because a startup by
definition is a company that is still iterating on their business model.
So a startup needs to be optimized for learning and finding product-market fit,
and that requires constantly changing processes.

Given that in a startup a product manager wears multiple hats and is responsible
for shipping on budget and on time, we'll cover some project management
essentials in

## Program management

When projects get too complex, like building the next generation commercial
airliner, or you want to make changes to the way a company is doing things,
then you might need a program manager.

In some companies, project managers are not very technical, so they might not
be able to fully assess the risks of the project, or even the requirements and
possible solutions. It's also possible that program managers help define what
projects the company should focus on, and what projects should be offloaded to
external companies, or just postponed.

## Overall

In this case the role of a program manager can overlap with a product manager.
Since there's not a one-size fits all role, each company ends up creating their
own definition and responsibilities for each of these roles. So a Program
Manager in a company is often times a Product Manager in some other company.

When applying to any of these roles, the best way to be sure what is the meaning
of one of these roles in that particular company, is to pay close attention to
the responsibilities listed in the job description.
