# What this book is about

Since the beginning of my career I've been intrigued by Product Managers. In
those days I could sense that Product Managers were generally smart, but I
could not pinpoint why I felt that way. More importantly I didn't understand how
exactly they contributed to the software development lifecycle.

I didn't understand their role, their responsibilities, and the output of
their work.

After working in the industry for eight years in the high-tech enterprise market,
and having moved to the Bay Area, I started thinking about becoming a Product
Manager myself.

When going down that path, I realized that not only this role was kind of new,
at least in the software industry, but also that there weren't a lot of
high-quality resources out there.

That's why I've wrote this book.

## Why I wrote this book

When I started to consider more seriously to transition into a PM role,
I read as many books as I could get my hands on. I've also crawled the web
searching for other high-quality resources about Product Management, and how
to break into the field.

Of course not all books and resources are alike. Some were great, others a bit
of a disappointment. All in all I was left with the sense that there was a ton
of resources out there, but could not find anything that gave me the big
picture about the Product Management role.

As I tried to build the big picture for myself and compiling my own notes,
I started thinking that I could save others a lot of time, so that they
wouldn't have to go through the same trouble.

I don't expect you to know everything there is to know about PM in this book,
and I'm not sure if that's even possible. Instead, I'll try to give you the
big picture, dive deeper into some areas that I think deserve a bit more
attention, and point you in the right direction.

I hope that after reading this you don't have to waste time randomly combing
through books and blog posts, in the hopes of getting a better understanding
of the field.

## Who is this book for

This book is for you if you're considering going into the PM field, or you
just landed your first PM job.

This book might also be interesting for other folks that interact with PMs.
If you work in engineering, marketing, sales, support, or technical field,
just to name a few.

Understanding the Product Manager role and responsibilities will help you
communicate more effectively with them and get work done. It can also help
if you're working with a somewhat dysfunctional Product organization that
works in a silo. By understanding what PMs do you can hopefully can help your
company break some silos that might exist between the Product organization and
the rest of your company.

<startups, where you need to wear a lot of hats.>

## Who am I

I've worked in the high-tech industry for eight years, helping companies
create enterprise products that are easy to use, and ideally require no
documentation or training.

I started working for OutSystems, an enterprise low-code platform that lets
you visually develop your entire application and deploy it natively on iOS or
Android devices, or to the web. There I created documentation, training, and
certification programs for developers. I've also helped doing UX research.

Then I moved to the Bay Area where I worked at Docker, the world's leading
software container platform, enabling millions of users to build, ship, and run
applications that are reproducible and work anywhere. There I lead the
documentation for the enterprise product suite, and lead some UX research
initiatives.

At both companies, I saw in first hand what it takes for you to build, market,
and sell products that developers are passionate about. I also got to
experience the pain points of working for companies that are grew by 3X since
the time I joined.

At both of these companies I got to work with a ton of amazing engineers,
designers, product managers, program managers, project managers, and a bunch
of other folks essential to create products people want.

I also got to see first hand a ton of mistakes that caused us to ship late,
over budget, or worse, something that users didn't really care about.
