# Give and receive feedback

There's a ton of good resources out there dedicated to gathering and providing feedback,
but since this is crucial to a Product Manager, it makes sense to cover some
strategies I find effective.

## Getting feedback

Even though everyone agrees that feedback is important, few people will go out of
their way to give you feedback. This is specially true as you climb the corporate
ladder and others see you as as an authority figure or a thought leader.

Effective Product Managers know how to navigate this and find ways to constantly
collect feedback from their stakeholders. Both the teams working directly in
products they manage, but also other people in the company that will have an
impact in the success of the product.

Few people go out of their way to provide feedback because that's the safest
thing to do. If you're not sure how others will react to the feedback, and
potentially damaging a relationship, why should you risk providing feedback?

So if you want to get hard and honest feedback, you need to create an environment
for it to happen.

- Put a deadline, or people will continuously postpone it
- Don't ask for too much at once
- Ask for 3 things to keep and why. Asking why will help you understand how people
see your impact.
- Ask for 3 things to improve with contextual examples. It's very easy to criticize
others without providing specific examples or instances were they displayed that
behavior. Without contextual examples, it's hard to know if people have a bias, if
they just don't like something you did, or if genuinely there's something you're
doing consistently that could be changed.

In startups is specially hard to get feedback for multiple reasons:

* Everything is burning all the time. So it feels that there is never enough time to
stop and reflect on what things you need to improve.
* Most startups won't have formal evaluation sessions, that explicitly force people to
stop and provide feedback.

This means that in the first couple of times you ask for feedback, it's possible that
few people reply. Don't get discouraged by this. Start by selecting the few people with
interact most frequently, and don't stop asking for concrete feedback until they give
you something.

Then formalize this practice, by making it recurrent. I personally try to do this at the
end of each quarter, since three months is enough time to see and measure change but also
keeps me focused in improving myself. When I ask for feedback on an annual basis, its
very easy to lose track on what you're supposed to be improving after the first couple
of months.

## Providing feedback

Providing feedback can be a bit more challenging than asking for feedback, because you're
never sure how people are going to react.
But as a Product Manager you can't shy away from this. Typically Product Managers don't
have authority over the teams they work with, so you need be able to influence change
by providing feedback.

There's a ton of strategies and ideas on how to provide feedback to people. The most
common advice out there goes by a lot of different names, but I like to name things
by their name - the shit sandwich.

The basic idea is that you should provide the shitty feedback layered in praise and
recognition. It goes like this

I like working with you and you do this list of things well. But on the other hand
you suck at these other things. But don't worry, you're great and you'll be able to
fix it.

The problem with this strategy is that smart and experienced people smell the shit
sandwich a mile away. And as soon as it starts to stink they'll start bracing for
impact and completely ignore any kind of praise you provide.

In a way, it's like when your a child and going to take the shots. The nurse tells
you a bunch of stuff to get you relax, but you're no dumb and know what's coming
for you. So nothing they can say can make up for the fact that she's going to
stick you with a needle.

But the main problem I have with this way of delivering feedback is that it's grounded
on the assumption that people don't want to get feedback and improve. And I
refuse to accept that.

Sure people might have been trained in an environment that makes them avoid
feedback. But people that want to be the best in what they do know that feedback
is necessary.

So instead of assuming that people are going to avoid feedback like the plague, why
not just be fully transparent and upfront with them, and ask them how do they
prefer receiving feedback?

By allowing people to control when and where you'll give them feedback, people will
be more open to it, and know that you have their best interest in mind.

This is actually simpler than it sounds. When working with someone just ask them
if they prefer getting feedback:

* Publicly or privately
* While their exhibiting what you think needs to change, or after the fact

While you're at it, you should also ask them how they prefer being praised when
they overcome an obstacle or do something meaningful. Not everyone loves being
put on the spotlight, so asking people directly how they want to be treated is
the best way for people to be open to feedback.
